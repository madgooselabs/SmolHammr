# When all you have is an array of overpowered hammers

This project is an attempt to make a Gamecube and USB HID board that is compatible with the scarce few analog levers on the market so far (and then some)

# Target boards

* Teensy 4.1 (main target; timings look ok so far)
* Raspberry Pi Pico (wishful thinking)
* Blue and Black pills (it's possible, if anything)

# TODO

* Actual testing on a Gamecube or close to
* TinyUSB for HID

# Completion guesstimates

* Base code: 60% needs tinyUSB
* Teensy support: largely untested 60%
* Pico support: does not compile
* Pill support: 0% not started
